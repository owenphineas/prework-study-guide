# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This is the prework study guide webpage. The function of the webpage is to act as a collection of notes on what I learned in the prework section of coding bootcamp. My primary motivation in creating this webpage was to get practical experience building a webpage using HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. Throughout the process of putting this webpage together, I've taken a big step towards learning the foundations of these coding languages as well as GitHub.
